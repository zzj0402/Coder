# Coder

Coder practice from LeetCode/HackerRank.

## Coder Definition

Coder is an intelligent agent who communicates through symbolic languages, such as English, C++, or Python.

## Goals

This repository not only tests language scripting skill but also teamwork potential. Depending on the role in a team, submitting a report for each problem.

### Architecture Officer

A good architect should have a solid sense on integrity of the solution.
Test cases are the foundation for such sense.
Hence, this repository is for practicing test case writing for them.

#### Test Cases

##### Edge Cases

### Planning Officer

Finding alternative approaches to a typical problem.
This will help you brainstorming.

#### Solution Proposal

### Executive Officer

Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms to help decision making.

#### Time complexity

#### Space complexity

### Technology Officer

Optimal algorithm achieves way more than dumb codes.
So does a coder who knows algorithm well.

#### Language features

### Service Officer

Visualization the algorithm to communicate with people, inside and outside the team.

#### Visualization Document

### Financial Officer

#### Cost Analysis

### Warrant Officer

#### Security Vulnerabilities

## Workflow
1. Identify use cases (FO)
1. Planning solutions (PO)
1. Analyzing options (EO)
1. Write test cases (AO)
1. Implement codes(TO)
1. Documentation(SO)
1. Break implementation (WO)
